	<p class="text-center text-white">Phenomenology is an ethical and philosophical principle introduced by Edmund Husserl, a German philosopher. Phenomenology, simply put, seeks “essential truth’s” of life through lived experience. Duane H. Davis, a professor at the University of North Carolina, suggests using Phenomenology to observe ourselves in the third person as we go about our daily lives to recognize our biases and behaviors with the hopes of developing a more neutral mindset. Davis suggests using phenomenal intentionality to behave more impartially in social situations to tackle modern issues regarding division, like racism and sexism.
I raise the question to you, as you journey through this installation: does overanalyzing our behaviors and developing this “impartial” mindset seem practical and effective in conquering these modern issues?
