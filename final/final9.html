	<h4 class="text-center text-white">Gadamer, a German philosopher, suggests that the concept of “play” is an integral part of the human experience. It’s crucial to our well-being that we act spontaneously from time to time, and live presently, or else risk losing ourselves and wasting our lives. He suggests that we cannot control what makes us react, only whether we choose to share that. We may cry when responding to some things and feel nothing when presented with others. That is human nature. It is how we relate to one another authentically. Not getting along with everyone means that the connections we do choose to make are purposeful and real.</h4>
