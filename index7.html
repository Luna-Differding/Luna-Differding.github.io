<p style="color:white;">You are materialize in a white room which appears to be void of any furniture aside from a large mirror with a simple black frame. You notice how perfect you look. Every small flaw that you used to nag over in the mirror has dissapeared. You look healthy and confident. Your newfound vanity is interrupted by a thundering disembodied voice: "You have made it to the final plane. Choose wisely." Mystified, you turn around and see a baby. It looks just like your niece, in fact it may very well be. You pick her up and find a note taped to her back. It reads: "FEED THE DRAGON". You knit your eyebrows. What dragon? You whip your head around and notice: one of the walls has dissapeared, revealing a cell not unlike ones found in jail, only much larger. A small baby sized slot is located at the bottom right corner. You look down at the child. What will you do?</p>
