<p style="color:white;">A white flash blinds you as you step into the doorway. Suddenly, you are standing in front of your childhood home, except nothing surrounds it. From the dstance, you see your mother approaching. She is waving to you, smiling. Suddenly she picks up her speed. From speed walking, to jogging, and eventually sprinting at you at a speed that seems impossible for her age and stature. You see, now that she is closer, that your mother is brandishing a large, glowing sword. Your mother is no longer smiling. She stares at you with a look of pure hatred. "Your ruined me," she cries hysterically. You realize now that an identical sword is in your hands. Will you use it?</p>
<a href="index.html">This cannot be my real mother. Use the sword.</a>
