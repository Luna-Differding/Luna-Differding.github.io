	<p class="text-center text-white"> Statement: Hey it's Biggie Cheese and I'm Singing on the Streets for Money, is a light-hearted piece whose sole purpose is to coax a laugh out of viewers. I saw a printed out image of "Biggie Cheese" in my friends dorm. I thought it'd be funny to make it seem like Biggie was a struggling street artist, singing not just for pleasure, but for money. My hope was that through the use of the caption, I could function as dry humor as well as a bit of additional context. </p>

	<p class="text-center text-white">Process: I found an image of Biggie Cheese on the internet. Since it had a transparent background already, I was able to easily lay it over the second image in photoshop, which I created using Adobe Firefly's text to image AI. Once one was neatly placed over top of the other, I used the paintbrush to add some shadows under Biggie Cheese. I screenshotted the image, leaving some black on the top and bottom, opened the screenshot in Photoshop and was easily able to caption it.
