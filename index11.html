<p style="color:white;"> You stumble through the portal and into you room. You are wildly relieved. But somethings not right. You don't feel quite the same in your body. You still have your enhanced features. You gaze at yourself for a moment before shrugging and collapsing onto your bed. "OWWW," you grumble. Your head has hits a boxy solid shape which is hidden by your covers. You pull the covers back and find one hundred million trillion dollars! You check your phone, which you're now noticing you've had this whole time and you see a plethora of missed notifications. You see that cute friend of yours texted you asking if you'd like to go out sometime one on one. Your mom said she's made your favorite meal for dinner. Your work emailed you regarding a call concerning a higher up position for which you're the perfect candidate. The list goes on. You could get used to this.</p>
