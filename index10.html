<p style="color:white;">You can't bring yourself to kill this thing. Even if it's just an illusion, your niece embodies the hope and purity that you wished you possesed. You are hoping to God that keeping her alive was the right thing to do. You look at her and she yanks your hair gently. A portal opens up. Through it you can see your real niece. The baby in your arms silently thanks you before vanishing, as if giving you her blessing. The image the portal shows has changed. It now shows your cozy room. Even in it's messy state, you've never been so glad to see it.</p>
